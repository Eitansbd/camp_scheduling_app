# camp_scheduling_app

The time slots data passed into the `DailySchedlue` object is of the structure:
  `[{time_slot_id: [start_time, end_time]}, {time_slot_id: [start_time, end_time]}, ...]`
  
The data passed into the `Activity` object includes the `name`, `location`, `id`

The data passed into the `Bunk` object includes `name`, `division`, `gender`, `id`.

I did not test anything because I needed your changes for most of it
